# Distributed Imaging Services (Skeleton)

Minimal placeholder C++ project ready to be pushed to GitHub.

## Build and run

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o dist-imaging && ./dist-imaging
```

## Next steps

- Replace the dummy program with real functionality.
- Add tests, a build system (CMake/Make), and CI once project requirements are known.
